IMPORTANT NOTE:

This material is based on research using data from ATLAS, obtained through https://amr.vivli.org

Data used in the challenge (https://amr.vivli.org/data-challenge/data-challenge-overview/) sourced from Vivli (https://amr.vivli.org), CLSI (https://clsi.org) and EUCAST (https://www.eucast.org) cannot be published here. They can be accessed by contacting the organisation in question and used under their license terms.

This means that the codes used for the analysis cannot run as they require those data. They have been deposited here for transparency/completeness and to comply with the conditions of Vivli's Data Challenge policy. To address this issue, the present study will be submitted for open access publication in the very near future.
